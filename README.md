# Fraud Detection Project

## üìå Objective
This project develops a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions using the provided dataset (`Fraud.csv`).  
The goal is to identify high-risk transactions in real time and provide actionable business insights to help reduce fraud losses.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
- **Rows:** 6,362,620  
- **Columns:** 10  
- **Fraud Cases:** 8,213 (~0.13% of all transactions)  
- **Data Dictionary:**
    - `step` ‚Äî Time step in hours (1 step = 1 hour; total 744 = 30 days)  
    - `type` ‚Äî Transaction type (`CASH-IN`, `CASH-OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, `TRANSFER`)  
    - `amount` ‚Äî Transaction amount in local currency  
    - `nameOrig` ‚Äî ID of customer initiating the transaction  
    - `oldbalanceOrg` ‚Äî Balance before transaction  
    - `newbalanceOrig` ‚Äî Balance after transaction  
    - `nameDest` ‚Äî ID of recipient  
    - `oldbalanceDest` ‚Äî Recipient's balance before transaction (NaN for merchants `M...`)  
    - `newbalanceDest` ‚Äî Recipient's balance after transaction (NaN for merchants `M...`)  
    - `isFraud` ‚Äî 1 if the transaction is fraudulent, else 0  
    - `isFlaggedFraud` ‚Äî 1 if flagged by rule (transfer > 200,000), else 0  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The dataset is highly imbalanced. Class balancing techniques such as **SMOTE** are applied during model training.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Reviewed dataset structure, missing values, fraud distribution, and class imbalance.
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created merchant flag, aggregated customer transaction stats, handled NaNs carefully.  
3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Scaled numeric features, encoded categorical variables via pipelines.
4. **Class Balancing**  
   - Applied **SMOTE** to training data only.
5. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented **XGBoost Classifier** with early stopping for efficiency.  
6. **Evaluation**  
   - ROC Curve, Precision‚ÄìRecall Curve, Average Precision Score, Confusion Matrix, and Threshold Tuning.
7. **Business Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identified patterns in fraud transactions and proposed prevention strategies.

## üìä Key Findings
- `CASH-OUT` and `TRANSFER` transactions account for most fraud cases.
- Large transaction amounts executed in short time frames are common in fraud.
- Unusual transaction hours often correlate with fraudulent activity.
- The dataset's `isFlaggedFraud` rule misses many frauds that the model detects.
